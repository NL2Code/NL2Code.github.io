  + Details
    * We use a BPE-based tokenizer similar to that used in GPT-2, with the same total vocabulary size of 50257, with three major changes to the tokenizer:
    * 1) we train a new BPE tokenizer based on the Pile;
    * 2) the tokenizer applies consistent space delimitation regardless;
    * 3) our tokenizer contains tokens for repeated space tokens.

  + hardware: We trained GPT-NeoX-20B on twelve Supermicro AS-4124GO-NART servers, each with eight NVIDIA A100-SXM4-40GB GPUs and configured with two AMD EPYC 7532 CPUs. All GPUs can directly access the InfiniBand switched fabric through one of four ConnectX-6 HCAs for GPUDirect RDMA. Two NVIDIA MQM8700-HS2R switches—connected by 16 links compose the spine of this InfiniBand network, with one link per node CPU socket connected to each switch.
