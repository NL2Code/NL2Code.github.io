- Contribution: 
    + We propose CODER, a multi-agent framework with task graphs for issue resolving. Inspired by the issue resolving process by humans in the real world, we design the roles and the actions. For plans, we design a graph data structure that can be parsed and strictly executed. It can ensure the exact execution of the plan and at the same time provide an easy-to-plug interface for plan injection from humans. 
    + We leverage LLM-generated code for reproducing the issue and the tests in the repository (excluding the verification tests) to get code coverage information. Coverage information improves contextual retrieval based on the keywords in the issue text and does fault localization together with BM25.
    + We renew the state-of-the-art of SWE-bench lite to 28.33% (85/300) with only one submission per issue.
