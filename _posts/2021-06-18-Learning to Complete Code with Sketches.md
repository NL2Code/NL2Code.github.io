  + This paper's dataset
- 💕Contribution
  + We present Grammformer, a transformer-based model that generates code based on the programming language grammar and can predict hole tokens rather than output it is uncertain about.
  + We develop RegexAcc, a metric that can evaluate the fit of predictions with holes.
  + We evaluate Grammformer on large corpora of Python and C# code and show that Grammformer can make longer and more precise statement-level sketch completions compared to a number of baselines.
