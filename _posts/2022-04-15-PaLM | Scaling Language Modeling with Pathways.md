- 💕Contribution
  + To further our understanding of the impact of scale on few-shot learning, we trained a 540-billion parameter, densely activated, Transformer language model, which we call Pathways Language Model (PaLM).
  + On a number of these tasks, PaLM (-Coder) achieves breakthrough performance, outperforming the finetuned stateof-the-art on a suite of multi-step reasoning tasks, and outperforming average human performance on the recently released BIG-bench benchmark. 

## 🎃Proposed Model

- Model Name: `PaLM-Coder`
- Publisher/Date: `Arxiv/2022`
- Author Affiliation: `Google Research`
- Architecture: `Transformer-based neural networks (decoder)`
- Pre-Traing Corpus: We finetune the  PaLM model[^palm] in two stages: (a) first finetuning for 6.5B tokens on a mixture of 60% Python code from ExtraPythonData, 30% code across languages (from the same source as the pre-training code data, but which was not included in pretraining), and 10% natural language, and (b) finetuning for an additional 1.9B tokens on more Python code from ExtraPythonData. 
- Supported Natural Language: `multilingual`
- Supported Programming Language: `Java`; `HTML`; `JavaScript`; `Python`; `C`; `PHP`; `C#`; `C++`
- Model Size: `8B`; `62B`; `540B`
- Public Item: `None`
- 🔗URL: `None`

## 📚Proposed Benchmark

- Benchmark Name: `GSM8K-Python`
- Publisher/Date: `Arxiv/2022`
- Author Affiliation: `Google Research`
- 🔗URL: `None`
- Sub-benchmark
  * GSM8K[^gsm8k]
- Feature: Mathematics word problem
- Details: We also introduce the GSM8K-Python task, which is derived from the GSM8K dataset[^gsm8k]. GSM8K consists of 8.5K high quality grade school math problems created by human problem writers.
