  + Data Resource
    * Same with Codex: which is a 159 GB Python dataset scraped in May 2020. 
  + De-duplication: ✅
  + Filter Strategies
    * We filtered out files which were likely auto-generated: average line length greater than 100;
    * maximum line length greater than 1000;
    * contain a small percentage of alphaunmeric characters.
