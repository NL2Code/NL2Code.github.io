## [CodeSearchNet](https://github.com/github/CodeSearchNet)
> The primary dataset consists of 2 million (comment, code) pairs from open source libraries. Concretely, a comment is a top-level function or method comment (e.g. docstrings in Python), and code is an entire function or method. Currently, the dataset contains Python, Javascript, Ruby, Go, Java, and PHP code.

## [JuICe](https://github.com/rajasagashe/juice)
> To create JuICe we first collect all publicly available Jupyter notebooks from github.com created before May 2019 and filter for notebooks having NL markdown in English and Python 2/3 as their kernel type. We observe that the presence of NL markdown is correlated with notebook quality and remove any notebooks that have more than three times the number of code cells as the number of NL cells, leaving us with âˆ¼ 659K notebooks.

## [The Pile](https://pile.eleuther.ai/)
> The Pile is a 825 GiB diverse, open source language modelling data set that consists of 22 smaller, high-quality datasets combined together.

## [APPS](https://huggingface.co/datasets/codeparrot/apps)
> a benchmark for code generation with 10000 problems.

## [Github-Code](https://huggingface.co/datasets/codeparrot/github-code)
> The GitHub Code dataset consists of 115M code files from GitHub in 32 programming languages with 60 extensions totaling in 1TB of data. The dataset was created from the public GitHub dataset on Google BiqQuery. 1) a 1TB dataset of 32 programming languages from GitHub files. 2) a cleaner version of GitHub-Code dataset.

## [GitHub-Jupyter](https://huggingface.co/datasets/codeparrot/github-jupyter)
> The dataset was extracted from Jupyter Notebooks on BigQuery. 1) a 16.3GB dataset of Jupyter Notebooks from BigQuery GitHub. 2) a dataset of text and code pairs extracted from Jupyter notebooks, it is a parsed version of github-jupyter dataset.
