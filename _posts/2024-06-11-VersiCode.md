- Contributions:
    + We propose two novel and important yet under-explored tasks in code generation, namely version-specific code completion (VSCC) and version-aware code editing (VACE);
    + We curate VersiCode, a new, large-scale version-controllable code generation dataset, aimed at comprehensively evaluating LLMs’ performance on the above two tasks;
    + We conduct comprehensive experiments on VersiCode, demonstrating that it is a high-quality and challenging dataset. The benchmarking results reveal that most LLMs struggle with version-specific code generation, especially with the latest libraries, highlighting areas for future exploration.
