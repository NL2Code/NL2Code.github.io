    * We collect a large unsupervised source code dataset to train and evaluate the code sequence completion model. It comprises over 1.2 billion lines of source code in Python, C#, JavaScript and TypeScript programming languages. A total of over 52000 top-starred (non-fork) projects in GitHub has been selected, containing libraries from a diverse set of domains, with over 4.7 million source code files.
