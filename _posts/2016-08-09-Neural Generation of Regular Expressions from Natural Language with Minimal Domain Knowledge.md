  + NL-RX (see below)
- 💕Contribution
  + In contrast to prior work, the proposed neural model does not utilize domain-specific crafting, learning to translate directly from a parallel corpus.
  + To fully explore the potential of neural models, we propose a methodology for collecting a large corpus of regular expression, natural language pairs.

## 📙Proposed Benchmark

- Benchmark Name: `NL-RX`
- 📚Publisher/Date: `EMNLP/2016`
- 🏠Author Affiliation: MIT; Microsoft
- 🔗URL: [https://github.com/nicholaslocascio/deep-regex](https://github.com/nicholaslocascio/deep-regex)
- Feature: Multi-turn Evaluation
- Details: Using the procedure described above, we create a new public dataset (NL-RX) comprising of `10,000` regular expressions and their corresponding natural language descriptions. The following shows an example from our dataset.

  ```
  Synthetic: lines not words with starting with a capital letter
  Paraphrased: lines that do not contain words that begin with a capital letter
  Regex: ∼ (\b([A-Z])(.*)\b)
  ```

- Supported Metric: `Accuracy`
