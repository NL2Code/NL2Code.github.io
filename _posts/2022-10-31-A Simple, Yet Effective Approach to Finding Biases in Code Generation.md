- 💕Contribution
  + We propose a novel automated framework that identifies possible biases in a coding style dataset. Our framework removes subtle hints, introducing minimal changes in the form of keyword replacement or partial code-block omission, ultimately acting as an adversarial test. Suggested changes resemble typical errors of a human coder and challenge the generational capabilities of the model under test. Since the framework operates on a data level, it is agnostic to the model’s structure and internal workings. Finally, the framework can be easily adjusted to any input format or programming language.
  + We introduce the "Blocks of Influence" concept. We suggest that every instance of a typical coding challenge can be analyzed into three parts (blocks). Each part is correlated with a different method of hinting and is used as a target of our transformations. A model's reasoning process is informed by all three blocks, making them perfect analyzing tools for cases of failing code generation.
  + We explore new ways of achieving robustness during code generation. We also study the effects of adversarial training against our proposed perturbations and the benefits of including examples with longer descriptions during finetuning. Our results show that combining these techniques leads to higher model resilience.
