- Contributions:
    + We propose a novel framework for statically-typed programming languages, CatCoder, to generate repository-level code by highlighting relevant code and type context in code repositories.
    + To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to construct a repository-level code generation benchmark for Rust, to evaluate the effectiveness of CatCoder on a minor programming language.
    + We evaluate CatCoder using Java and Rust benchmarks, and results indicate that CatCoder outperforms the baselines.
