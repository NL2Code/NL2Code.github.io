## 📚Proposed Benchmark

- Benchmark Name: `NL2Bash`
- 📚Publisher/Date: `Other/2018`
- 🏠Author Affiliation: University of Washington
- 🔗URL: [https://github.com/TellinaTool/nl2bash/tree/master/data](https://github.com/TellinaTool/nl2bash/tree/master/data)
- Feature: Generating linux shell commands
- Details: The corpus consists of text–command pairs, where each pair consists of a Bash command scraped from the web and an expert-generated natural language description. We collected `12,609` text–command pairs in total. After filtering, `9,305` pairs remained. We split this data into train, development (dev), and test sets, subject to the constraint that neither a natural language description nor a Bash command appears in more than one split.
- Supported Metric: `manual evaluation`; $Acc^{k}_{F}$; $Acc^{k}_{T}$
- Test Case: ❌
- 🔏Input (NL)
  + 🚩Language: `English`
  + 🌟Format
    * [ ] Code Context
    * [x] Plain Natural Language
    * [ ] Competition Problem

    * [ ] TODO
    * [ ] Pseudocode

  + 💈Description Granularity
    * [ ] Why? (Background)
    * [x] What? (Requirement, TODO)
    * [ ] How? (Algorithm Process)

  + 🚩Language: `Bash`
  + ⛺Domain
    * [x] General
    * [ ] Data Analysis and Manipulation
    * [ ] Plotting

## 🚩Proposed Metric#1

- Metric Name: $Acc^{k}_{F}$
- Definition: We define $Acc^{k}_{F}$ to be the percentage of test instances for which a correct full command is ranked $k$ or above in the model output.

## 🚩Proposed Metric#2

- Metric Name: $Acc^{k}_{T}$
- Definition: We define $Acc^{k}_{T}$ to be the percentage of test instances for which a correct command template is ranked $k$ or above in the model output (i.e., ignoring incorrect arguments).
