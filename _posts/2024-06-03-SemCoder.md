- Contributions:
    + The development of SemCoder, a semantic-aware Code LM designed to enhance understanding and reasoning about program semantics.
    + We introduce Monologue Reasoning, a novel execution learning approach that aligns static source code with its runtime behavior through detailed verbal descriptions of code execution.
    + To expose comprehensive program semantics at different levels, we curate PYX, a collection of executable code samples with functional descriptions and execution traces.
