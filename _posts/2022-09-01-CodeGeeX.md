  + Data Resource
    * The Pile
    * CodeParrot
    * Scapped from the public GitHub repositories that do not appear in previous datasets, including Python, Java and C++
  + De-duplication: /
  + Filter Strategies
    * A file is filtered out if it has more than 100 characters per line on average
    * is automatically generated
    * has a ratio of alphabet less than 40%
    * is bigger than 100KB or smaller than 1KB
    * To help the model distinguish different languages, we add a language-specific prefix at the beginning of each segment in the form of [Comment sign] language: [LANG], e.g., # language: Python.
- 🍉Tokenizer
  + Technology
    * [x] Byte-level Byte-Pair-Encoding (BBPE)
    * [ ] SentencePiece
  + Details
    * We use the same tokenizer as GPT-2 and process whitespaces as extra tokens
