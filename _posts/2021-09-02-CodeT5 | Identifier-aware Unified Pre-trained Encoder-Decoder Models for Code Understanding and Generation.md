- 💕Contribution
  + We present one of the first unified encoderdecoder models CodeT5 to support both coderelated understanding and generation tasks, and also allows for multi-task learning.
  + We propose a novel identifier-aware pretraining objective that considers the crucial token type information (identifiers) from code. Besides, we propose to leverage the NL-PL pairs that are naturally available in source code to learn a better cross-modal alignment.
  + Extensive experiments show that CodeT5 yields state-of-the-art results on the fourteen sub-tasks in CodeXGLUE. Further analysis shows our CodeT5 can better capture the code semantics with the proposed identifier-aware pre-training and bimodal dual generation primarily benefits NL↔PL tasks.
