- 🗂️Data pre-processing
  + Data Resource
    * Our data consists of 118k GITHUB repositories, which includes all public repositories labelled as containing primarily PYTHON source code, featuring at least 10 stars, and which have had a commit in the past 5 years.  We successfully cloned 112k of these repositories, extracting 5.3 million PYTHON files from the default HEAD state of each repository.
  + De-duplication: ✅
  + Filter Strategies
    * We use the python 3.7 standard library ast to produce the file-level AST for each Python file
    * use 2to3 and autopep8 to overcome the issue of different styles and white space or tab convertions
    * use the Python module astunparse to take the AST for each method and unparse them back into source code
    * ignore comments as they generally represent trivia and are not part of the normal language syntax
    * clean the docstrings by removing non-ASCII characters, normalizing Unicode, and replacing commit hashes, file paths, and URLs with placeholder tokens
