- 🗂️Data pre-processing
  + Data Resource
    * We first pre-train our models on a large and diverse corpus of public code with permissive licenses, which covers multiple programming languages. Python, Java, C++ are the dominant languages in our corpus, accounting for most of the re-training data.
    * Apart from pre-training our model on public code datasets, we also pretrain our model on natural language, specifically the union of the following datasets: CC-News, OpenWebText, CC-Stories and CC-100.

  + Technology
    * [x] Byte-level Byte-Pair-Encoding (BBPE)
    * [ ] SentencePiece
  + Details
    * Our tokenizer is based on the Byte-Pair Encoding algorithm widely used in previous work [Codex] to directly encode raw bytes with a vocabulary of size 100257 tokens. We pre-tokenize the text using a special regex pattern that accounts for splitting on digit and newlines together with the default GPT-2 pre-tokenization.
