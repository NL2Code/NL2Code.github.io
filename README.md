# [Large Language Models Meet NL2Code: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09420.pdf)

We build a real-time updated websit for NL2Code powered by LLMs, [click here to visit the website](https://nl2code.github.io/).

We hope that our work can facilitate the research work of researchers in LLMs for NL2Code. Furthermore, we also hope everyone can contribute to the website by adding up-to-date NL2Code papers.
